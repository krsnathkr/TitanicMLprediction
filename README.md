# Titanic Machine Learning Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting survival rates on the Titanic dataset. It utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure
- **train.csv**: Training dataset
- **test.csv**: Test dataset
- **Titanic_ML_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Titanic_ML_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions.

## Contents
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Visualization
3. Preprocessing
4. Model Building (Random Forest Classifier)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy Score)

## Result
The trained Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 83.24% on the test dataset.
